Shaarli-Bootstrap Theme
=======================

Shaarli-Bootstrap is a theme for [Shaarli](https://github.com/shaarli/Shaarli), the famous personal, minimalist, super-fast, database free, bookmarking service.


## Goal
The goal of this theme is to be as minimal as possible, using all the wonderful things Bootstrap has to offer, nothing more.

The theme is HTML+CSS only, for now. Let's see how far we can get with it.
The layout is focused on 'mobile' only, for now. (But works just fine on bigger screens.)


## Compatibility
Shaarli-Bootstrap is tested with [Shaarli 0.10.3](https://github.com/shaarli/Shaarli/releases/tag/v0.10.3).


## Installation
1. [Install your copy of Shaarli](https://shaarli.readthedocs.io/en/master/Download-and-Installation/)
2. Finish the setup process.
