Shaarli-Bootstrap Theme
=======================

Shaarli-Bootstrap is a theme for [Shaarli](https://github.com/shaarli/Shaarli), the famous personal, minimalist, super-fast, database free, bookmarking service.


## Goal
The goal of this theme is to be as minimal as possible, using all the wonderful things Bootstrap has to offer, nothing more.

The theme is `HTML`+`CSS` only, (with some cheating here and there). Let's see how far we can get with that.
The layout is focused on 'mobile' use only, for now. (But works just fine on bigger screens.)


## Compatibility
Shaarli-Bootstrap is tested with [Shaarli 0.10.3](https://github.com/shaarli/Shaarli/releases/tag/v0.10.3) up to
[Shaarli 0.11.1](https://github.com/shaarli/Shaarli/releases/tag/v0.11.1).


## Installation
1. [Install your copy of Shaarli](https://shaarli.readthedocs.io/en/master/Download-and-Installation/)
2. Finish the setup process.
3. Copy this folder `Shaarli-Bootstrap` into the `tpl/` folder. (Next to `default/` and `legacy/`)
